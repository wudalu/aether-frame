## Critical Dependencies & Risk Management

### Updated Critical Path Analysis

**Phase 1 Dependencies (Sequential)**:
1. **Week 1 → Week 2**: UserAgentManager must be functional before DynamicAgentFactory integration
2. **Week 1-2 → Week 3**: Multi-session architecture must be stable before state management
3. **Week 1-3 → Week 4**: Core session management must work before tool security integration

**Phase 2 Dependencies (Parallel with Prerequisites)**:
1. **Week 5**: Requires stable Phase 1 foundation for resource monitoring baseline
2. **Week 6**: Requires Week 5 monitoring data for performance optimization
3. **Week 7**: Requires Week 5-6 completion for comprehensive testing

### High-Risk Items & Updated Mitigation

#### **CRITICAL RISK - Week 1: ADK Multi-Session Feasibility**
- **Risk**: ADK architecture may not support efficient multi-runner approach
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Build minimal prototype with 2-3 concurrent sessions in first 3 days
  - Measure actual memory/CPU overhead per additional session
  - Have fallback plan to single-session-per-user if resource consumption too high
- **Go/No-Go Decision**: End of Week 1 based on prototype performance

#### **HIGH RISK - Week 2: Dynamic Agent Creation Complexity**
- **Risk**: LLM-based agent configuration may be too complex or unreliable
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with simple template-based approach with 5-6 predefined agent types
  - Use LLM only for parameter customization, not full agent design
  - Create fallback to manual agent configuration if LLM approach fails
- **Success Metrics**: 80% successful agent creation from user requests

#### **MEDIUM RISK - Week 4: Tool Security Implementation**
- **Risk**: Complex sandboxing may delay delivery or introduce vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with subprocess isolation and resource limits
  - Defer advanced container-based sandboxing to Phase 3
  - Focus on permission system and audit logging over complex isolation
- **Minimum Viable Security**: Basic subprocess + timeout + permission checks

### External Dependencies

#### **Updated ADK Framework Compatibility**
- **Current**: Google ADK 1.13.0+ with InMemoryRunner support
- **Risk**: ADK version updates may break multi-session approach
- **Mitigation**: Pin ADK version, maintain compatibility testing

#### **Infrastructure Requirements**
- **Week 1-4**: Development environment with 8GB+ RAM for multi-session testing
- **Week 5-7**: Load testing environment simulating 50+ concurrent users
